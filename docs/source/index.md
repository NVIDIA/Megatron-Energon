# Megatron-Energon Documentation

This is the documentation of Megatron's multi-modal data loader "Energon".

We recommend getting started in the [Introduction](intro/introduction) section, which introduces this package and contains a few code snippets to get you started quickly.

**TODO!**

To better understand the underlying concepts, please read the [Basic Concepts](basics_dataconcepts) section.

In the end you will also find a [code documentation](modules) with the most important classes and methods.

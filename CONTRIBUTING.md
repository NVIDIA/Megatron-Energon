## Megatron-Energon OSS Contribution Rules


#### Coding Guidelines

- We recommend to discuss and plan contributions by opening an issue beforehand.

- All source code contributions must strictly adhere to ruff linter and formatter as configured in `pyproject.toml`.
    - You can check those by running `just check`.

- All source code files must include the NVIDIA license header as you can see in `src/megatron/energon/__init__.py`.

- In addition, please follow the existing conventions in the relevant file, submodule, module, and project when you add new code or when you extend/fix existing functionality.

- Avoid introducing unnecessary complexity into existing code so that maintainability and readability are preserved.

- Try to keep pull requests (PRs) as concise as possible:
  - Avoid committing commented-out code.
  - Wherever possible, each PR should address a single concern. If there are several otherwise-unrelated things that should be fixed to reach a desired endpoint, our recommendation is to open several PRs and indicate the dependencies in the description. The more complex the changes are in a single PR, the more time it will take to review those changes.

- Ensure that all tests pass prior to submitting your code.

- All components must contain accompanying documentation in `docs/source`.

- Make sure that you can contribute your work to open source (no license and/or patent conflict is introduced by your code). You will need to [`sign`](#signing-your-work) your commit.


#### Signing Your Work

* We require that all contributors "sign-off" on their commits. This certifies that the contribution is your original work, or you have rights to submit it under the same license, or a compatible license.

  * Any contribution which contains commits that are not Signed-Off will not be accepted.

* To sign off on a commit you simply use the `--signoff` (or `-s`) option when committing your changes:
  ```bash
  $ git commit -s -m "Add cool feature."
  ```
  This will append the following to your commit message:
  ```
  Signed-off-by: Your Name <your@email.com>
  ```
